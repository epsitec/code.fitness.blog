# JSHint is complaining about my ES7 code

ES2015 source code is identified correctly by current versions of JSHint
(as of this writing, Atom `jshint` package has version 1.8.3). However,
trying to use experimental (`stage-0`) language features like _decorators_
produces error messages:

```js
@bar
class Foo {
}
```

JSHint displays:

> JSHint 1:1 Unexpected token ILLEGAL

This is by design. Don't try to find a setting which would enable support
for `stage-0` langage features â€“ you won't find any.

The JSHint Team [explains how new language features
will get added to JSHint](http://jshint.com/blog/new-lang-features/) and
why `stage-0` and `stage-1` won't be included, even in the foreseeable
future.
