By default, `hugo` binds to `http://127.0.0.1:1313/` when started
using this command line:

```bat
hugo.exe server -w
```

But recently, I have no longer been able to execute the server.
Every time, it complained that the port 1313 was already in use.

Digging around with [TCPView](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/tcpview.aspx)
I finally located the culprit. I had installed _Elasticsearch_
as a service a few days ago (process `elasticsearch-service-x64.exe`)
and it opens **lots** of ports for its intra-cluster communication.

Out of luck, port 1313 was already used by Elasticsearch.

The solution is simple:

* Open the _View Local Services_ control panel.
* Locate _Elasticsearch 1.5.0_ (in my case).
* Click on the stop button.
* Launch _hugo_.
* Start _Elasticsearch 1.5.0_ so that it will be available again.
