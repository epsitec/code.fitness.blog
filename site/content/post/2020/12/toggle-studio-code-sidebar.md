I have a hard time remembering how to toggle the **sidebar** in **Visual Studio Code**. Switching to the Explorer is easy: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+E</kbd> does the trick, and there is a tooltip which helps when I no longer remember the shortcut... But closing the sidebar?

The shortcut to close (or toggle) the sidebar is <kbd>Ctrl+B</kbd> and I hope that by writing this post, it will help me remember it. At least, I'll have a handy resource if I forget it in the future...

> Might the **B** stand for side**B**ar &mdash; maybe. At least this could prove to be a trick to get the **B** stick along in my long-term memory ;-).
